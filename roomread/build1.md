# Build One Check In
## What works now:
- User authentication with supabase
- Dashbaord with personalized greeting
- Featured Countries Section with one country
- Country page opens to:
  - Flag
  - Five etiquette categories
- Beginner lessons implemented
- Lesson content loads dynamically through JSON
- Clean and easily navigated UI

---

## What does not work yet:
- No lessons beyond beginner introduction
- No unlock system tied to actual lesson completion
- No minigames worked into lessons
- No animations

---

## Top priorities for build two
- Store lesson completion in database to track user progress
- Add categories to enter more lessons than just beginner
- Progress persists across sessions
- Add completion badges
- Add minigames and interactive photos
- More animations within the UI
